## About the Project
Breast cancer is a serious health issue that impacts thousands of people every year. Early detection and diagnosis are key to effective treatment. This project uses machine learning algorithms to predict the presence of breast cancer, focusing on model accuracy and interpretability.

The project includes:
- Data preprocessing and analysis
- Feature selection and engineering
- Training and testing of machine learning models
- Evaluation of model performance

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains various features related to breast cancer, which were selected to maximize prediction accuracy.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/breast-cancer-prediction.git
    cd breast-cancer-prediction
    ```

2. Install the necessary packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
After installation, you can run the `Breast-Cancer.py` file to preprocess the data, train the model, and make predictions.

```bash
python Breast-Cancer.py
```

## Model Information
This project uses several machine learning algorithms, including:
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machines
- Decision Trees
- Random Forests
- K-Nearest Neighbors

Each model's performance is evaluated and compared to select the most accurate one.

## Results
The model with the highest accuracy achieves 99% on the test set. Further details on performance metrics and analysis are provided in the `results` section.
